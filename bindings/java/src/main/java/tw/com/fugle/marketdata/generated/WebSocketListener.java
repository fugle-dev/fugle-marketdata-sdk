/**
 * Callback interface for WebSocket events
 *
 * Foreign code (C#, Go) implements this trait to receive WebSocket events.
 * The implementation must be thread-safe (Send + Sync) as callbacks may be
 * invoked from background tokio tasks.
 *
 * # Example (C#)
 *
 * ```csharp
 * class MyListener : IWebSocketListener {
 * public void OnConnected() {
 * Console.WriteLine("Connected!");
 * }
 * public void OnAuthenticated(string? dataJson) {
 * Console.WriteLine("Authenticated");
 * }
 * public void OnUnauthenticated(string? dataJson) {
 * Console.WriteLine($"Rejected: {dataJson}");
 * }
 * public void OnDisconnected(bool willReconnect) {
 * Console.WriteLine($"Disconnected (will reconnect: {willReconnect})");
 * }
 * public void OnMessage(StreamMessage message) {
 * Console.WriteLine($"Got {message.Event} for {message.Symbol}");
 * }
 * public void OnError(string errorMessage) {
 * Console.WriteLine($"Error: {errorMessage}");
 * }
 * }
 * ```
